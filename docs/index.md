Just write to start a para. Use `**word**` to bold **word**. Use `*word*` to italicise. For a new para, you need to hit return at-least twice.

This is another para.

- an item
- another item

In this new para we create a numbered list using numbers.
1. first item
2. second item

You can write code by using triple-ticks:

```python
def add_two(x, y):
  return x + y
```
